This presentation contains a pre-formatted template for the impact pathway.\nMake a Copy: Once you open the link, go to File &gt; Make a copy &gt; Entire presentation. Rename the file with your team or project name (e.g., ‚ÄúTeam Alpha - Impact Pathway‚Äù or ‚ÄúProject X - Impact Pathway‚Äù). This will ensure you can edit your own version without affecting the original template.\nCollaborate with Your Group: Work with your assigned group to fill in each section of the impact pathway diagram. Use the template as your guide. The different sections are as follows:\n\nR.D.E. Project Outputs: What specific deliverables or results are produced directly by your project? Consider the categories of Technology, Capacity Development, and Policy.\nAdoption Pathway: How do the project outputs translate into actions or changes by your target audience? Think about the steps that lead from the outputs to the outcomes, such as Commercialization, Communication, Capacity Building, and Regulation.\nProject Outcomes: What are the short-to-medium-term changes that occur as a result of the project outputs being adopted? Focus on changes in Practice, Product, and Policy.\nProject Impacts: What are the long-term, broader effects of the project outcomes? Categorize these impacts as Economic, Social, and Environmental.\n\nPresentation of Workshop Outputs: A representative from each team will have 5-10 minutes to explain their group‚Äôs pathway. The focus should be on clearly articulating the logical flow from outputs to impacts and justifying the connections between each stage.",
